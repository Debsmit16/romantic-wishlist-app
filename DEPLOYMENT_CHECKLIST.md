## 🌐 Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "🎉 Initial release: Romantic Wishlist App v1.0.0

✨ Features:
- 9 beautiful romantic themes
- Interactive wishlist management
- Floating particles and animations
- Mobile-responsive design
- Local storage persistence
- Secret planner mode
- Open When letters feature"

# Add remote origin (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/romantic-wishlist.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import from GitHub
4. Select your repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect Vite settings
6. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] All themes work on production
- [ ] Mobile version functions properly
- [ ] Local storage works in production
- [ ] No console errors in production

## 📝 Environment Variables (None Required)
This app runs entirely client-side with localStorage, so no environment variables are needed for basic functionality.

## 🔄 Future Updates
To deploy updates:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✨ Update: [description]"
git push origin main
```
Vercel will automatically redeploy on push to main branch.

## 🎯 Production URL
After deployment, update the README.md with your actual Vercel URL:
- Replace `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app` with your actual URL

## 🚨 Troubleshooting
If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
3. Verify no hardcoded localhost URLs
4. Check for any missing files or imports
